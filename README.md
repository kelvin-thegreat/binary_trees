Binary trees are a type of data structure commonly used in computer science and programming. They consist of nodes, where each node can have at most two children: a left child and a right child. The topmost node in the tree is called the root.

Each node in a binary tree can have a value associated with it, and these values can be of any type depending on the specific use case. The nodes in the tree are connected by edges, which represent the relationships between the nodes.

The binary tree has a hierarchical structure, meaning that each node (except for the root) has a parent node, and the nodes that are connected to a particular node are called its children. The children of a node are ordered, with the left child typically being smaller (or equal) in value and the right child being larger (or equal) in value.

Binary trees are commonly used for various purposes, including representing hierarchical data structures, implementing search algorithms like binary search, and providing efficient storage and retrieval of data.

There are different types of binary trees, such as binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, red-black trees, and more. Each type of binary tree has its own set of rules and properties that define its behavior and performance characteristics.

Binary trees can be traversed in different ways, such as in-order traversal, pre-order traversal, and post-order traversal. These traversal methods define the order in which the nodes of the tree are visited and processed.
